HM Product Full Tabs

Editor uses Term ID inputs for Category/Tag:
- Products > Categories: open the category -> URL contains tag_ID=TERM_ID
- Products > Tags: same, term_id appears in URL

Frontend:
- Renders WooCommerce products by product_cat/product_tag term_id
- Slider is scroll-snap (no swiper dependency)
- Full Bleed (Hero Like) makes the block 100vw via negative margins
